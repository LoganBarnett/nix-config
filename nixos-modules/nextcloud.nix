# NextCloud is a fork of OwnCloud - an open source self-hosted "cloud" suite.
# It offers calendar, email, task management, video calls, file storage, and a
# number of other features (typically via apps).
#
# Some Nextcloud + NixOS resources:
# - https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nextcloud
# - https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#module-services-nextcloud
# - https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/servers/nextcloud/packages/README.md
# See
# https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#module-services-nextcloud-basic-usage
# for the official documentation (though it isn't much of a reference).
#
# Use `nextcloud-occ` for the `occ` command.  Here's an exmaple:
# sudo -u nextcloud nextcloud-occ ldap:show-config
#
# See
# https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/servers/nextcloud/packages/README.md
# can be used to emit new packages from the app store.  It uses
# https://github.com/helsinki-systems/nc4nix to do the conversion.  Why not just
# do them all?  In any case, it needs a fix.  It works fine on macOS.  I should
# submit a pull request to nixpkgs to fix that.  Adding "user_ldap" to the JSON
# file didn't work - nothing new got emitted.  Might require some debugging.
# The "user_ldap" app is somewhat special because it lives in Nextcloud itself:
# https://github.com/nextcloud/server/tree/master/apps/user_ldap
# The official Nextcloud LDAP docs are here:
# https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_user/user_auth_ldap.html
#
# You can see a listing of apps on https://apps.nextcloud.com or locally via
# https://nextcloud.proton/settings/apps.
#
# This setup might seem a little janky but I have to fight with systemd quite a
# bit to make it robust and able to survive a reboot.  In essence, there's been
# a lot of work in making sure the system mounts and mounts again (once for NFS,
# the other for limited permissions) before anything that needs to _use_ those
# mounts gets to run.  If those mounts aren't in place, these processes will
# still write something but it will be wrong.  Thus you will see some belt and
# suspender stuff - checks that are redundant, but I found helpful when trying
# to get everything working.  I'd like to leave it in place unless these
# (possibly) redundant checks prove problematic in some way.
