# Rubidium is a potassium-like alkaline metal.  One of its uses is to add purple
# to fireworks.  It can hypothetically be used to build an armature for a
# generator, but because it reacts violently with oxygen like lithium does,
# (my speculation) there are some difficulties in employing it.  Maybe since
# we're already using lithium for fusion reactors, rubidium will also find a
# place.
#
# Rubidium is my headless code host.  I can write software and direct the LLMs
# to do the things here.
#
# The hardware is a Mac Mini 7,1 (Late 2014) with an Intel Core i5-4260U
# (Haswell) CPU.
