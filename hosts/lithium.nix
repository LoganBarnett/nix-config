# This defines the entirety of the configuration for the lithium host.
#
# The lithium host is currently tasked as a machine learning server.  It has a
# very beefy profile for a typical server, as it has served a former life as a
# gaming rig.
#
# The lithium host uses BIOS despite the BIOS being littered with "UEFI"
# verbiage.
#
# The final NixOS module is the server specific configuration, with everything
# before that being reusable modules (or parameterized, reusable modules).
