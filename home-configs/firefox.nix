# Firefox browser configuration with managed extensions and preferences.
#
# Extensions are sourced from NUR (github:nix-community/NUR) via the
# rycee/nur-expressions addon collection.
#
# The prefers-color-scheme override ensures websites correctly receive the
# dark mode signal — without it, Firefox on macOS does not propagate the OS
# dark mode preference to websites via the prefers-color-scheme media query,
# even when the OS and browser are both set to dark mode.
#
# profiles.ini is managed by home-manager as a read-only Nix store symlink.
# Firefox 67+ tries to write an [Install<hash>] section to it on first
# launch; the hash is derived from the Firefox binary path and changes with
# every Nix store update, so it cannot be pre-computed statically.  Setting
# browser.profiles.enabled = false disables the per-installation profile
# management UI (added in Firefox 129) so Firefox silently falls back to
# StartWithLastProfile / Default=1 without showing a picker.  The failed
# background write of the Install section does not cause a crash.
#
# Sideloaded extension auto-disable: home-manager symlinks the extension
# .xpi files into Profiles/default/extensions/.  Firefox treats anything
# discovered through the filesystem (rather than installed via about:addons
# or AMO) as a "foreign install" and, since Firefox 73, marks them
# userDisabled=true on first discovery — even when signedState=2 (signed by
# Mozilla).  The extensions.autoDisableScopes pref is a bitfield of install
# scopes whose foreign installs should be auto-disabled (default 15 = all:
# profile|user|system|application).  Setting it to 0 lets all scopes through.
# This pref only applies when the addon is *first discovered*; if Firefox
# has already cached an extension as disabled in extensions.json /
# addonStartup.json.lz4, the pref change alone won't re-enable it — those
# state files must be deleted so Firefox rescans the .xpi files and applies
# the new pref to the fresh discovery.
