# Public/private nginx split for silicon.
#
# Private services (*.proton) listen on 192.168.254.9, which the router never
# forwards externally.  Public services (future real TLDs) will listen on
# 192.168.254.100, which the router port-forwards TCP 443 -> .100.
#
# The nftables rule below provides defense-in-depth: even if the router is
# misconfigured to forward traffic to .9, non-RFC-1918 source addresses are
# dropped at the host firewall before reaching nginx.  The custom table runs
# at priority -1 so it fires before the nixos-fw chain at priority 0; this
# ensures our DROP takes precedence over nixos-fw's ACCEPT for allowed ports.
