# Stand up OctoPrint for a Prusa XL.
#
# Sometimes the UI will be stuck in a redirect loop.  I'm not sure what breaks
# it out.  If the STL viewer is installed, it will come up first just before the
# redirect happens, but if the STL viewer is not installed, the redirect loop
# still occurs, so I think that is a false path.  I suspect it is involved and
# somehow bucks against authentication.
#
# Managing users here is a pain.  First, there must be an admin user in order
# for this to start.  No, you can't null out the password, but you can make the
# user inactive.  To bootstrap an admin user, you can use:
# sudo -u octoprint octoprint --basedir /var/lib/octoprint user add admin --admin
# You will likely have to grab the current octoprint bin path, using:
# systemctl cat octoprint.service
# Alternatively, you can just plop this into `/var/lib/octoprint/users.yaml`:
# admin:
#    active: false
#    apikey: null
#    groups:
#    - admins
#    password: $argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=4$000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
#    permissions: []
#    roles:
#    - user
#    - admin
#    settings: {}
# Once you have that, you kind of have LDAP managed users but not really.  The
# documentation suggests you can setup a kind of group mapping that might make
# this work, but I don't have a working example and haven't experimented with it
# yet.  A user with read permission is not sufficient to log in, for some
# reason.  You'll need to add those permissions to the user by hand _after_
# attempting to log in as them - The LDAP plugin will write the user out to that
# same users.yaml file.  Once it's there, you can add `admins` to the `groups`
# list, and `admin` to the `roles` list.  From there you _must_ restart
# Octoprint for the changes to get picked up.
#
# Failure to create the admin user will result in weird refresh loop stuff when
# the browser hits the page.  Yay.  I think the typical workflow is that it
# redirects to the wizard and makes you configure things from there, but we
# turned that off.  During upgrades of Octoprint versions, you might find other
# oddities like that.
#
# During the time I last ran into this, I had `accessControl = false;` and that
# could be related, but I haven't done anything to confirm this.
