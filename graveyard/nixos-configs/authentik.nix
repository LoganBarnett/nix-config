# TOMBSTONE -- Authentik is no longer active.
#
# Authentik is a Python-based identity manager providing centralized
# authentication similar to Keycloak.
#
# Authentik was abandoned because it silently fails to record users.  By
# design, errors do not surface in the systemd journal, making it impossible
# to know when user configuration is broken -- an infrastructure-level trust
# failure.  We migrated to Authelia, which surfaces errors clearly and provides
# password reset flows and richer access-control policies.
#
# The import in hosts/gallium.nix was already commented out.  This file is
# kept for historical reference.

  # Why are we using YAML templates here instead of serializing Nix expressions?
  # Sit down for a moment, and let us tell you a tale of sadness and treachery.
  # Authentik makes use of a YAML feature called "tags".  This is a special form
  # of a string / scalar that YAML uses to create references to itself in the
  # document.  Some parses know how to understand this instead of treating the
  # entire document as inert data.  Such YAML documents cannot round trip
  # through serializers.  They require this because their structures want to
  # refer to primary, auto incremented keys in a database.  So to keep those
  # auto generated keys (which aren't remotely portable) out of the config
  # files, they chose to rely on tags (instead of just making the slug or id
  # unique and referencing that for some reason...).  Is Authentik to blame for
  # using such a criminal feature, or is YAML for introducing such a feature?
  # An exercise for the reader as their tear their hair out trying to serialize
  # a Nix expression into the YAML that Authentik wants to see.  This is why we
  # use a YAML template.
  #
  # Use the `indentLines`function above to help with placating a significant
  # whitespace language.
  #
  # Beware trailing '' in Nix.  I will impact the ultimate indentation of the
  # strings emitted, which as you know in YAML, straight up breaks the
  # structure.
  #
  # Beware also your _starting_ indentation.  Keep your list emission code flush
  # with the attribute you are hanging off of (instead of indenting under said
  # attribute, which will be the temptation).  Not doing this will lead to
  # initial spacing on the first item to be off (indented one set too far).
