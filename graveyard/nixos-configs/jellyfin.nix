# TOMBSTONE -- Jellyfin is no longer hosted.
#
# Jellyfin is a free and open-source media server.  It served the contents of
# /tank/data/media, which Metube populates via yt-dlp downloads.
#
# Jellyfin requires manual administration via its web UI to become operable
# after a fresh installation (initial user creation, library setup, etc.),
# which is incompatible with a fully declarative NixOS deployment.
#
# This file is not imported by any host and is kept for historical reference.
