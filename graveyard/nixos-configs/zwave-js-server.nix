# TOMBSTONE -- zwave-js-server is no longer hosted.
#
# Configures zwave-js-server (aka node-zwave-server) for managing a Z-Wave
# controller.  It produces very verbose logs but has fallen out of active
# maintenance, and is more strict about pairing and interviewing in ways that
# are unhelpful.
#
# Z-Wave JS tooling is designed as a companion to Home Assistant.  We are no
# longer running Home Assistant.  Hardware secrets are retained in
# hardware/aeotec-z-stick-7.nix.  This file is kept for historical reference.
