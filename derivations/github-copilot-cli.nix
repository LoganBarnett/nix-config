# When people say "Copilot", this is what they mean.  There is an AWS Copilot (a
# competitor fork?).
#
# The pinned nixpkgs now packages the current github/copilot-cli repo, but it
# trails releases, given how fast things are moving for github-copilot-cli.
# This copy of the derivation exists so the version can be bumped here.
#
# Using `overrideAttrs` doesn't work per
# https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Node.js#Override_NodeJS_package but its counter
# instructions also don't work well, so just provide the entire derivation.  You
# will also want to run this to update the copilot-package-lock.json when an
# update is needed:
# npm-generate-package-lock-json https://registry.npmjs.org/@github/copilot/-/copilot-0.0.342.tgz copilot
#
# And then copy the file as needed to the derivations directory - make sure it
# is named `copilot-package-lock.json`, which the program should do for you.
# You can find the script declared here:
# ../scripts/npm-generate-package-lock-json
