# MakeMKV 1.17.7 -- binary-only package for firmware flashing.
#
# MakeMKV 1.18.x has a bug where `makemkvcon f` (the firmware tool) spins at
# 100 % CPU and never actually flashes.  This derivation extracts just the
# prebuilt makemkvcon binary from the 1.17.7 bin tarball and patches it for
# NixOS, linking against the current MakeMKV's shared libraries.
#
# Usage:
#   makemkvcon f --all-yes -d /dev/sr0 -f sdf.bin rawflash enc -i firmware.bin
#
# Update the version and hash in static.nix when upstream fixes the bug and
# this package is no longer needed.
