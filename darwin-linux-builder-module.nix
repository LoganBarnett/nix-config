    # recently got garbage collected.
    # Sometimes toggling this value isn't enough.  This is when one should
    # disable the VM here at this setting, and switch to apply it, then:
    # `sudo rm -f # /var/lib/darwin-builder/nixos.qcow2`

    # not responding over SSH, despite holding the port open and negotiating a
    # TCP connection).
