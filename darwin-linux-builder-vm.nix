##
# NixOS can be bootstraped in various ways but it requires running on the target
# architecture and OS.  Both of these can be emulated but not presently on
# macOS.  So instead we fire up a VM that's running Nix.  The nix-darwin module
# provides a handy way to stand all of that up.  This is the configuration that
# goes into the `config' attribute for nix-darwin's linux-builder.  This VM is
# stateful, and requires both some bootstrapping and some manual invocation to
# operate.  Once up, it should present itself as a "builder" (a Nix entity) for
# the local Nix installation.
#
# To force changes to take effect:
# sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/org.nixos.linux-builder
#
# To get a fresh image:
# 1. Set linux-builder.enabled (in ./darwin.nix) to false.
# 2. Run `proton-deploy switch <host>`.
# 3. Run `nix run nixpkgs#darwin.linux-builder'.
# 4. Verify the VM starts up correctly.
# 5. Run `shutdown now` in the VM.
# 6. Set linux-builder.enabled (in ./darwin.nix) to true.
# 7. Run `proton-deploy switch <host>`.
# 8. Observe the new instance running.
#
# *Getting to run as a builder*
#
# I'm still working on this.  I can see the builder with `nix store ping --store
# ssh-ng://linux-builder`, but it does not trust my host.
